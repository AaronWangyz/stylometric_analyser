# Assumptions and Limitations:
•	Assumed user only wants to see the result plots, but not result tables
•	Used menu selection to show plot based on user’s choice
o	Menu selection takes letters rather than numbers because PyCharm is having problem with console input. Seems like numbers took by console is somehow different with numbers in the coding section. This is proved when attempting to debug this using “print” function, same number, but cannot pass “==” check.
•	IMPORTANT! As mentioned in the header documentation of “main_28619943.py”, user will encounter a problem of cannot manually close the plot-showing window by pressing “x”. This is not a bug generated by my code but a general bug of “matplotlib.pyplot” library.
(Post of similar problem on StackOverflow: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/34108696/cannot-manually-close-matplotlib-plot-window, the solution does not work anymore.)
To solve this problem, look at the console after pressed “x” of the plot-showing window, the console will respond and keep executing, just enter new input when console prompts for.
The new input sometimes will have to be entered twice, first time the plot-showing window terminates, second time produce new plot.
•	The runtime is very long if using the full text provided by the instructor, the console will show a message of “Processing articles, this may take few minutes.” Then act non-responding-like, please be patient, it is processing.
